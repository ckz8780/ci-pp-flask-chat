# Welcome!

This is a simple chat application written in Flask. It is part of the Practical Python module for CodeInstitute.

The app demonstrates the use of URLs to send data to the server, write it to a file, then read that file back to the user. The site uses javascript to reload every 5 seconds to post new messages, or users can manually refresh it to see if anything new has been posted.
